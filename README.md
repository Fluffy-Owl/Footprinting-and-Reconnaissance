# Footprinting-and-Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance refers to collecting information about a target, which is the first step in any attack on a system.

Footprinting refers to the process of collecting information about a target network and its environment, which helps in evaluating the security posture of the target organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure. (Passive or Active)

But before you start this process, consider the following:
- Define scope with management: systems, networks, policies, personnel.
- Agree on rules of engagement (RoE) with management.
- Obtain approval for ethical hacking activities.
- Start gathering information via footprinting.
- Develop a security blueprint from footprinting results.

There are several objective for footprinting and reconnaissance:
- **Organization Information:** Employee details, addresses and contact details, partner details, weblinks, web technologies, patents, trademarks, etc.
- **Network Information:** Domains, sub-domains, network blocks, network topologies, trusted routers, firewalls, IP addresses of the reachable systems, the Whois record, DNS records, and other related information
- **System Information:** Operating systems, web server OSes, location of web servers, user accounts and passwords, etc.
